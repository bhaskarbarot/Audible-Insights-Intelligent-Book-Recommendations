It's an unquestioned truth of modern life: we are starved for time. With the rise of two-income families, extreme jobs, and 24/7 connectivity, life is so frenzied we can barely find time to breathe. We tell ourselves we'd like to read more, get to the gym regularly, try new hobbies, and accomplish all kinds of goals. But then we give up because there just aren't enough hours to do it all. Or else, if we don't make excuses, we make sacrifices. To get ahead at work we spend less time with our spouses. To carve out more family time, we put off getting in shape. To train for a marathon, we cut back on sleep. There has to be a better way - and Laura Vanderkam has found one.

Draped in yellow silk, garlanded with forest flowers, bedecked with dolphin-shaped earrings, anointed with sandal paste, he reclines on a thousand hooded serpent that floats on an ocean of milk and rides a golden hawk bearing in his arms a conchshell, a wheel, a mace and a lotus. Poets say that when he is awake, the world takes shape; when he is asleep, the world ceases to be. Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, follows him wherever he goes. To him is made offerings of rich creamy butter. Sometimes, as the upright Ram, he is worshipped across India as Balaji, Shreenathji, Jagannath, Ranganath and Badrinath. Locked in the stories, symbols and rituals of Vishnu is the wisdom of the ancestors, transmitted over hundreds of years.

The ensuing battle sank the continent of Lemuria and drove the Reptilians underground beneath the Indian subcontinent as well as to Antarctica. Able to shapeshift to appear human, the Reptilians then infiltrated the Atlantean civilization, abducting humans and creating Reptilian hybrids. As Len Kasten shows, this technique of infiltration and hybridization prior to an all-out attack has been the hallmark of Reptilian conquest throughout the galaxy.

"Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain, And Body",Daniel Goleman,"Two New York Times best-selling authors unveil new research showing what meditation can really do for the brain. In the last 20 years, meditation and mindfulness have gone from being kind of cool to becoming an omnipresent Band-Aid for fixing everything from your weight to your relationship to your achievement level. Unveiling here the kind of cutting-edge research that has made them giants in their fields, Daniel Goleman and Richard J Davidson show us the truth about what meditation can really do for us, as well as exactly how to get the most out of it. Sweeping away common misconceptions and neuromythology to open listeners' eyes to the ways data has been distorted to sell mind-training methods, the authors demonstrate that beyond the pleasant states mental exercises can produce, the real payoffs are the lasting personality traits that can result. But short daily doses will not get us to the highest level of lasting positive change - even if we continue for years - without specific additions. More than sheer hours, we need smart practice, including crucial ingredients such as targeted feedback from a master teacher and a more spacious, less attached view of the self, all of which are missing in widespread versions of mind training. The authors also reveal the latest data from Davidson's own lab that point to a new methodology for developing a broader array of mind-training methods with larger implications for how we can derive the greatest benefits from the practice. Exciting, compelling, and grounded in new research, this is one of those rare books that has the power to change us at the deepest level.

An Era Of Darkness: The British Empire In India,Shashi Tharoor,"In 1930, the American historian and philosopher Will Durant wrote that Britain s conscious and deliberate bleeding of India... [was the] greatest crime in all history . He was not the only one to denounce the rapacity and cruelty of British rule, and his assessment was not exaggerated. Almost 35 million Indians died because of acts of commission and omission by the British in famines, epidemics, communal riots and wholesale slaughter like the reprisal killings after the 1857 War of Independence and the Amritsar massacre of 1919. Besides the deaths of Indians, British rule impoverished India in a manner that beggars belief. When the East India Company took control of the country, in the chaos that ensued after the collapse of the Mughal empire, India's share of world GDP was 23 per cent. When the British left it was just above 3 per cent.

The interrogation, which was done by the army and police, included torture of the worst kind imaginable. Many of his comrades went insane or ended their own lives. Large portions of his stories describe the methods used in gory and spine-chilling detail but there were also lighter moments with dacoits, prostitutes, pimps and dope smugglers in the same jails....' He witnessed history unfolding from Mianwali jail: '...when Sheikh Mujibur Rehman was brought there, and had his grave dug and then refilled when Bhutto released him to return in truimph to Bangladesh.

Anger: Buddhist Wisdom For Cooling The Flames,Thich Nhat Hanh,"Thich Nhat Hanh is a holy man, for he is humble and devout. He is a scholar of immense intellectual capacity. His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to world brotherhood, to humanity' Martin Luther King, Jr, in Nobel Peace Prize nomination It was under the bodhi tree in India 2500 years ago that Buddha achieved the insight that three states of mind were the source of all our unhappiness: ignorance, obsessive desire and anger. All are equally difficult to control but, in one instant of anger, lives can be ruined, and our spiritual development can be destroyed. Twenty-five centuries after the Buddha's insight, medical science tells us that the Buddha was right: anger can also ruin our health. It is one of the most powerful emotions and one of the most difficult to change. Thich Nhat Hanh offers a fresh perspective on taking care of our anger as we would take care of a baby crying - picking it up, talking quietly to it, probing for what is making the baby cry. Laced with stories and techniques, Anger offers a wise and loving look at transforming this difficult emotion into peace and for bringing harmony and healing to all the areas and relationships in our lives that have been affected by anger.",-1,-1,4.6,654.0,615.0,-1,['-1']

Badi Soch Ka Bada Jadu [The Magic Of Thinking Big],David Schwartz,"Badi Shoch Ka Bada Jadu is the Hindi translation of David J. Schwartz's best seller The Magic of Thinking Big. The author’s point of view is that thinking big is the way to success, that is, thinking positively about oneself. The main stumbling block that prevents many people from succeeding in their life is the smallness or inconsequential nature of their thoughts. Schwartz tries to prove that it is not necessary to have an inherent talent or be an intellectual for attaining success, but there is a need for a person to understand and learn the habit of behaving and thinking in ways by which he or she can reach the top. His book begins with the story of a salesman who is able to sell more, and make more money than his co-salesmen. He is not highly qualified, influential, or smarter than his friends. However, he just decides that he should sell more and eventually he achieves what he wants.",11 hours and 31 minutes,",#275 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#59 in Personal Success,#813 in Personal Development & Self-Help",4.5,805.0,836.0,,"['', '#275 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals)', '#59 in Personal Success', '#813 in Personal Development & Self-Help']"

An inspiring and motivating audiobook, it draws success mantras from the life and work of the actor. Describing it as a self-help book, the author goes back to the early struggles of Bachchan, connecting them with our deepest aspirations. What is success, and does happiness precede or follow success? He reflects on such questions by digging deeper into the trials and tribulations of Bachchan’s rise to fame. In his conversational style, the writer cites examples from everyday life and invites the listeners to think with him, as if he were sharing his thoughts and wisdom with a friend. He points out that in Indian cinema, any film that has a star cast will easily land a producer, distributors and dates for theatrical release and even draw in the advance bookings. Similarly, happiness is a superstar, he says. Through the audiobook, he explains how we can take control of our destiny and be the producer, director and star of our own lives. Bachchan’s life provides insight into how one can persevere through hope, despair, challenges and opportunities. What can we learn from his personal journey and from his larger-than-life image on the screen?   ",5 hours and 28 minutes,",#2,438 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#22 in Biographies of Celebrities & Entertainment Professionals,#351 in Personal Success,#3,030 in Biographies & Autobiographies (Books)",5.0,5.0,668.0,,"['', '#2', '438 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals)', '#22 in Biographies of Celebrities & Entertainment Professionals', '#351 in Personal Success', '#3', '030 in Biographies & Autobiographies (Books)']"

Brain Rules For Baby (Updated And Expanded): How To Raise A Smart And Happy Child From Zero To Five,John Medina,"What’s the single most important thing you can do during pregnancy? What does watching TV do to a child’s brain? What’s the best way to handle temper tantrums? Scientists know. In his New York Times best seller Brain Rules, Dr. John Medina showed us how our brains really work - and why we ought to redesign our workplaces and schools. Now, in Brain Rules for Baby, he shares what the latest science says about how to raise smart and happy children from zero to five. This book is destined to revolutionize parenting. Just one of the surprises: The best way to get your children into the college of their choice? Teach them impulse control. Brain Rules for Baby bridges the gap between what scientists know and what parents practice. Through fascinating and funny stories, Medina, a developmental molecular biologist and dad, unravels how a child’s brain develops - and what you can do to optimize it. You will view your children - and how to raise them - in a whole new light. You’ll learn: Where nature ends and nurture begins. Why men should do more household chores. What you do when emotions run hot affects how your baby turns out, because babies need to feel safe above all. TV is harmful for children under two. Your child’s ability to relate to others predicts her future math performance. Smart and happy are inseparable. Pursuing your child’s intellectual success at the expense of his happiness achieves neither. Praising effort is better than praising intelligence. The best predictor of academic performance is not IQ. It’s self-control. What you do right now - before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and through the first five years - will affect your children for the rest of their lives. Brain Rules for Baby is an indispensable guide.",9 hours and 26 minutes,",#1,459 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#7 in Parenting Infants & Toddlers,#50 in Relationships,#611 in Family & Relationships",4.6,802.0,702.0,,"['', '#1', '459 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals)', '#7 in Parenting Infants & Toddlers', '#50 in Relationships', '#611 in Family & Relationships']"

As he brings to light the immovable glass ceiling that exists for Dalits even in politics, bureaucracy, and judiciary, Yengde provides an unflinchingly honest account of divisions within the Dalit community itself - from their internal caste divisions to the conduct of elite Dalits and their tokenized forms of modern-day untouchability - all operating under the inescapable influences of Brahminical doctrines.",11 hours and 12 minutes,",#283 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#1 in Religious History,#1 in Church & State,#3 in Buddhism (Audible Audiobooks & Originals)",4.6,93.0,879.0,,"['', '#283 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals)', '#1 in Religious History', '#1 in Church & State', '#3 in Buddhism (Audible Audiobooks & Originals)']"

Days later, after exploring the rest of the house and garden, Coraline returns to the same mysterious door and opens it again. This time, however, there is a dark hallway in front of her. Stepping inside, the place beyond has an eerie familiarity about it. The carpet and wallpaper are the same as in her flat. The picture hanging on the wall is the same. Almost. Strangest of all, her mum and dad are there too. Only they have buttons for eyes and seem more possessive than normal. It's a twisted version of her world that is familiar, and yet sinister. And matters get even more surreal for Coraline when her ""other"" parents seem reluctant to let her leave.",3 hours and 34 minutes,",            5 star,          ,            ,              80%,            ,          ",4.7,2897.0,292.0,,"['', '5 star', '', '', '80%', '', '']"

Creating Great Choices: A Leader'S Guide To Integrative Thinking,Jennifer Riel,"A practical four-step methodology for any leader or manager facing a tough choice, and for creating integrative solutions to big, complex, and pressing problems. Conventional wisdom - and business school curricula - teaches us that making trade-offs is inevitable when it comes to hard choices. But sometimes, accepting the obvious trade-off just isn't good enough: the choices in front of us don't get us what we need. In those cases, rather than choosing the least worst option, we can use the models in front of us to create a new and better answer. This is integrative thinking. First introduced by Roger Martin in The Opposable Mind, integrative thinking is an approach to problem solving that uses opposing ideas as the basis for innovation. Now, in Creating Great Choices, Martin and fellow Rotman expert Jennifer Riel vividly show how they have refined and enhanced the understanding and practice of integrative thinking through their work teaching the concept and its principles to business and nonprofit executives, MBA students, even kids. Integrative thinking has been embraced by organizations such as Procter & Gamble, Deloitte, Verizon, and the Toronto District School Board - all seeking a replicable, thoughtful approach to creating a ""third and better way"" to make important choices in the face of unacceptable trade-offs. The book includes new stories of successful integrative thinkers that will demystify the process of creative problem solving. It lays out the authors' practical four-step methodology, which can be applied in virtually any context: ",-1,-1,4.7,35.0,703.0,-1,['-1']

Yet internally, culture is too often still regarded as an add-on, a one-off moment of focus or a distraction from the real day to day business. And when it is given that real focus, the approaches adopted to manage it can prove costly and campaign-like, leading to only temporary emphasis and shift.",-1,-1,4.7,8.0,645.0,-1,['-1']

Currency Wars: The Making Of The Next Global Crises,James Rickards,"In 1971, President Nixon imposed national price controls and took the United States off the gold standard, an extreme measure intended to end an ongoing currency war that had destroyed faith in the U.S. dollar. Today we are engaged in a new currency war, and this time the consequences will be far worse than those that confronted Nixon. Currency wars are one of the most destructive and feared outcomes in international economics. At best, they offer the sorry spectacle of countries' stealing growth from their trading partners. At worst, they degenerate into sequential bouts of inflation, recession, retaliation, and sometimes actual violence. Left unchecked, the next currency war could lead to a crisis worse than the panic of 2008.Currency wars have happened before-twice in the last century alone-and they always end badly. Time and again, paper currencies have collapsed, assets have been frozen, gold has been confiscated, and capital controls have been imposed. And the next crash is overdue. Recent headlines about the debasement of the dollar, bailouts in Greece and Ireland, and Chinese currency manipulation are all indicators of the growing conflict.As James Rickards argues in Currency Wars, this is more than just a concern for economists and investors. The United States is facing serious threats to its national security, from clandestine gold purchases by China to the hidden agendas of sovereign wealth funds. Greater than any single threat is the very real danger of the collapse of the dollar itself.Baffling to many observers is the rank failure of economists to foresee or prevent the economic catastrophes of recent years. Not only have their theories failed to prevent calamity, they are making the currency wars worse. The U. S. Federal Reserve has engaged in the greatest gamble in the history of finance, a sustained effort to stimulate the economy by printing money on a trillion-dollar scale. Its solutions present hidden new dangers while resolving none of the current dilemmas. While the outcome of the new currency war is not yet certain, some version of the worst-case scenario is almost inevitable if U.S. and world economic leaders fail to learn from the mistakes of their predecessors.

"Eastern Body, Western Mind: Psychology And The Chakra System As A Path To The Self",Anodea Judith,"In Eastern Body, Western Mind, chakra authority Anodea Judith has brought a fresh approach to the yoga-based Eastern chakra system, adapting it to the Western framework of Jungian psychology, somatic therapy, childhood developmental theory, and metaphysics. This groundbreaking work in transpersonal psychology has been revised and redesigned for a more accessible presentation. Arranged schematically, the book uses the inherent structure of the chakra system as a map upon which to chart our Western understanding of individual development. Each chapter focuses on a single chakra, starting with a description of its characteristics, then exploring its particular childhood developmental patterns, traumas and abuses, and how to heal and maintain balance. Illuminated with personal anecdotes and case studies, Eastern Body, Western Mind seamlessly merges the East and West, science and philosophy, and psychology and spirituality into a compelling interpretation of the chakra system and its relevance for Westerners today.

"Einstein'S Relativity And The Quantum Revolution: Modern Physics For Non-Scientists, 2Nd Edition",Richard Wolfson,"""It doesn't take an Einstein to understand modern physics,"" says Professor Wolfson at the outset of these twenty-four lectures on what may be the most important subjects in the universe: relativity and quantum physics. Both have reputations for complexity. But the basic ideas behind them are, in fact, simple and comprehensible by anyone. These dynamic and illuminating lectures begin with a brief overview of theories of physical reality starting with Aristotle and culminating in Newtonian or ""classical"" physics. After that, you'll follow along as Professor Wolfson outlines the logic that led to Einstein's profound theory of special relativity and the simple yet far-reaching insight on which it rests. With that insight in mind, you'll move on to consider Einstein's theory of general relativity and its interpretation of gravitation in terms of the curvature of space and time.

Essays 10: On The Shortness Of Life,Seneca,"On the Shortness of Life was written by Seneca around the year AD 49. He argues that we waste so much time because we do not properly value it. We expend great effort in protecting other valuables such as money and property, but because time appears intangible, we allow others to occupy it and take time away from us. Wise people, on the other hand, understand that time is the most valuable of all resources, and with effort can free themselves from external control to engage in meaningful introspection and create an intentional life.",-1,-1,-1.0,,47.0,-1,['-1']

Everybody Writes: Your Go-To Guide To Creating Ridiculously Good Content,Ann Handley,"Finally a go-to guide to creating and publishing the kind of content that will make your business thrive. Everybody Writes is a go-to guide to attracting and retaining customers through stellar online communication, because in our content-driven world, every one of us is, in fact, a writer. If you have a web site, you are a publisher. If you are on social media, you are in marketing. And that means that we are all relying on our words to carry our marketing messages. We are all writers. Yeah, but who cares about writing anymore? In a time-challenged world dominated by short and snappy, by click-bait headlines and Twitter streams and Instagram feeds and gifs and video and Snapchat and YOLO and LOL and #tbt... does the idea of focusing on writing seem pedantic and ordinary? Actually, writing matters more now, not less. Our online words are our currency; they tell our customers who we are. Our writing can make us look smart or it can make us look stupid. It can make us seem fun, or warm, or competent, or trustworthy. But it can also make us seem humdrum or discombobulated or flat-out boring. That means you've got to choose words well, and write with economy and the style and honest empathy for your customers. And it means you put a new value on an often-overlooked skill in content marketing: How to write, and how to tell a true story really, really well. So being able to communicate well in writing isn't just nice; it's necessity. And it's also the oft-overlooked cornerstone of nearly all our content marketing.

Evolve Your Brain: The Science Of Changing Your Mind,Joe Dispenza D.C.,"Joe Dispenza, DC, has spent decades studying the human mind - how it works, how it stores information, and why it perpetuates the same behavioral patterns over and over.

Evolve Your Brain presents this information in depth, while helping you take control of your mind, explaining how thoughts can create chemical reactions that keep you addicted to patterns and feelings - including ones that make you unhappy. And when you know how these bad habits are created, it's possible to not only break these patterns, but also reprogram and evolve your brain, so that new, positive, and beneficial habits can take over.

Flow: Living At The Peak Of Your Abilities,Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi Ph.D.,"In flow, everyday experience becomes a moment by moment opportunity for joy and self-fulfillment. Flow is the brain-child of a fascinating psychologist, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a renowned social scientist who has devoted his life's work to the study of what makes people truly happy, satisfied and fulfilled. While much of the study of psychology investigates disorders of the human mind, Dr. Csikszentmihalyi takes a different route. He focuses on the noble side of human nature, our capacity for living a life of integrity, courage, and perseverance. With his landmark research on flow, he reveals what he considers beautiful in life, ways of being and behaving that make people happy, satisfied and delighted to be alive. His insights into the ""flow experience"" show ways to lessen stress, fear and anxiety while increasing feelings of challenge, joy and excitement. The revolutionary findings of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's Experience Sampling Method offer unprecedented information about the specific ways we can turn life into a continuous high quality experience. You'll discover how anyone can enrich his or her quality of life simply by learning how flow occurs and what it feels like.

Hard Times Create Strong Men: Why The World Craves Leadership And How You Can Step Up To Fill The Need,Stefan Aarnio,"What does it mean to be a man in the modern world? Throughout history, being a man has meant different things. Maybe being a man was about being a good hunter, or a good soldier, a good businessman, or maybe good with women. Hard Times Create Strong Men examines what it means to be a man in the modern world relative to money, sex, religion, and politics. This audiobook examines what worked and what doesn’t work based on proven history instead of feelings. This audiobook is raw, real, and politically incorrect. It will threaten and challenge your ideas of what it means to be a man and how to better serve your purpose. As the cycles of history prove over and over again, hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create hard times”.",16 hours and 13 minutes,",#1,461 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#75 in Leadership,#227 in Personal Success,#2,297 in Analysis & Strategy",4.7,300.0,836.0,,"['', '#1', '461 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals)', '#75 in Leadership', '#227 in Personal Success', '#2', '297 in Analysis & Strategy']"

India Grows At Night: A Liberal Case For A Strong State,Gurcharan Das,"India's is a tale of private success and public failure. Prosperity is, indeed, spreading across the country even as governance failure pervades public life. But how could a nation become one of the world's fastest-growing economies when it's governed by a weak, ineffective state? And wouldn't it be wonderful if India also grew during the day - in other words, if public policy supported private enterprise? What India needs, Gurcharan Das argues, is a strong liberal state. Such a state would have the authority to take quick, decisive action; it would have the rule of law to ensure those actions are legitimate; and finally, it would be accountable to the people. However, India has always had a weak state and a strong society, says Das, which means that achieving something better will be an uphill struggle.",8 hours and 46 minutes,",#4,346 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#50 in Literary Essays,#1,020 in Essays (Books)",4.4,40.0,879.0,,"['', '#4', '346 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals)', '#50 in Literary Essays', '#1', '020 in Essays (Books)']"

Following Sharon to Los Angeles, Jacob offers his healing powers for free at a church in Los Angeles, and then at a seedy stage show where his beloved Sharon also works. It is when Jacob's gift is recruited to heal Earl Medwin, an eccentric, ailing young millionaire, that the love and security for which he has worked so hard begin to collapse.

Judgement Detox: Release The Beliefs That Hold You Back From Living A Better Life,Gabrielle Bernstein,"Judgement - both being judged and judging others - is at the core of our discomfort and the root of many of our life blocks. When we judge others, we get a quick hit of self-righteousness. Judgement can get us through when we feel hurt, insecure, or vulnerable. But inevitably this feeling of righteousness fades and judgement causes our energy to weaken and our thoughts to darken. Spiritual thought leader Gabrielle Bernstein made the commitment to heal her own relationship to judgement and changed her life in profound ways. She found that becoming more aware of her judgements made her a more mindful and conscious person. Her willingness to revise these perceptions has set her free. Here Gabrielle shares the process she used to liberate herself - a six-step interactive programme that calls on spiritual principles from A Course in Miracles, Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and other metaphysical and healing teachings. When you follow the process and become willing to let go, judgement, pain and suffering will begin to dissolve.

"Just. You. Wait.: Patience, Contentment, And Hope For The Everyday",Tricia Lott Williford,"Everybody waits. We wait for a spouse, wait for a baby, wait on our children, wait for our parents. We wait for clarity and direction. We wait on a job, a promotion, a new direction. We wait for hope, for healing, and for miracles. We wait on God. And when we misunderstand what waiting is about, we can get confused about what God is up to. Waiting is one of God’s favorite tools. He can do certain things in our hearts, our lives, and our relationships while we wait - things we cannot experience once we’ve opened the gift we have been waiting for. So just you wait, because everyone takes their turn in the waiting room. It’s a long and painful fact of life, but shortcuts and microwaves aren’t the answer. God is at work behind the scenes in invisible ways you can’t see...yet. Just you wait and see how ready you’ll be if you spend your waiting well. Because when your opportunity comes, you don’t want to spend more time on the bench. When you wait well, you can say, “Look out, world: I am getting ready to shine. Just you wait.” In this audiobook, Tricia discusses the joy hidden in the discipline of waiting, and the practices of believing God is for you and working on your behalf, even when the work of His hand is hard to find. ",4 hours and 56 minutes,",#3,044 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#3 in Christian Death & Grief,#4 in Women's Christian Living,#20 in Christian Spiritual Growth",4.9,22.0,586.0,,"['', '#3', '044 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals)', '#3 in Christian Death & Grief', ""#4 in Women's Christian Living"", '#20 in Christian Spiritual Growth']"

The evidence was gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and the author’s subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation. Darwin’s theory that species derive from other species by a gradual evolutionary process and that the average level of each species is heightened by the “survival of the fittest” stirred controversy and opposition.

In Orientalism Said claimed a ""subtle and persistent Eurocentric prejudice against Arabo-Islamic peoples and their culture."" He argued that a long tradition of false and romanticized images of Asia and the Middle East in Western culture had served as an implicit justification for Europe and the US' colonial and imperial ambitions. Just as fiercely, he denounced the practice of Arab elites who internalized the US and British orientalists' ideas of Arabic culture.

Science In The Soul: Selected Writings Of A Passionate Rationalist,Richard Dawkins,"Richard Dawkins - author of The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker and The God Delusion - is one of science's greatest communicators. This anthology of more than 40 pieces is a kaleidoscopic argument for the power and the glory of science. Breathtaking, brilliant and passionate, these essays, journalism, lectures and letters make an unanswerable case for the wonder of scientific discovery and its power to stir the imagination; for the practical necessity of scientific endeavour to society; and for the importance of the scientific way of thinking - particularly in today's 'post-truth' world.

St Urbain'S Horseman,Mordecai Richler,"St. Urbain’s Horseman is a complex, moving, and wonderfully comic evocation of a generation consumed with guilt - guilt at not joining every battle, at not healing every wound. Thirty-seven-year-old Jake Hersh is a film director of modest success, a faithful husband, and a man in disgrace. His alter ego is his cousin Joey, a legend in their childhood neighbourhood in Montreal. Nazi-hunter, adventurer, and hero of the Spanish Civil War, Joey is the avenging horseman of Jake’s impotent dreams. When Jake becomes embroiled in a scandalous trial in London, England, he puts his own unadventurous life on trial as well, finding it desperately wanting as he steadfastly longs for the Horseman’s glorious return.

Summary Of The Power Of Positive Thinking. A Practical Guide To Mastering The Problems Of Everyday Living,Sapiens Editorial,"The Power of Positive Thinking is a work that has become a classic of the self-improvement genre. Published in 1952, it has remained relevant throughout the years. The author explains how changes in thinking processes can influence outcomes that seem otherwise inevitable. His approach, based on faith and optimism, has laid the foundation for a stream of thought structured in sound principles to achieve desired goals and achieve happiness. It is a philosophy of faith that does not ignore the problems of life, but rather is dedicated to showing a practical way to stand in the face of adversity and overcome obstacles. At one time considered a controversial book, it aroused a lot of negative criticism. In spite of this, its success has continued, and millions are still praising its ideas on the benefits of positive thinking.",27 minutes,",#3,587 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#493 in Personal Success,#7,549 in Personal Development & Self-Help",-1.0,,166.0,,"['', '#3', '587 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals)', '#493 in Personal Success', '#7', '549 in Personal Development & Self-Help']"

The Beginning Of Infinity: Explanations That Transform The World,David Deutsch,"A bold and all-embracing exploration of the nature and progress of knowledge from one of today's great thinkers. Throughout history, mankind has struggled to understand life's mysteries, from the mundane to the seemingly miraculous. In this important new book, David Deutsch, an award-winning pioneer in the field of quantum computation, argues that explanations have a fundamental place in the universe. They have unlimited scope and power to cause change, and the quest to improve them is the basic regulating principle not only of science but of all successful human endeavor. This stream of ever improving explanations has infinite reach, according to Deutsch: we are subject only to the laws of physics, and they impose no upper boundary to what we can eventually understand, control, and achieve. In his previous book, The Fabric of Reality, Deutsch describe the four deepest strands of existing knowledge-the theories of evolution, quantum physics, knowledge, and computation-arguing jointly they reveal a unified fabric of reality. In this new book, he applies that worldview to a wide range of issues and unsolved problems, from creativity and free will to the origin and future of the human species.

The Bhagavad Gita,Eknath Easwaran,"The Bhagavad Gita, ""The Song of the Lord"", is the best known of all the Indian scriptures, and Easwaran's reliable and accessible version has consistently been the best-selling translation. Easwaran's introduction places the Gita in its historical setting and brings out the universality and timelessness of its teachings. Chapter introductions give clear explanations of key concepts in that chapter. To listen to the scripture without the introductions, listeners should start at track 044. The Bhagavad Gita opens dramatically on a battlefield, as the warrior Arjuna turns in anguish to his spiritual guide, Sri Krishna, for answers to the fundamental questions of life. But as Easwaran points out, the Gita is not what it seems - it's not a dialogue between two mythical figures at the dawn of Indian history. ""The battlefield is a perfect backdrop, but the Gita's subject is the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage"" to live a life that is meaningful, fulfilling, and worthwhile. This audio recording is a complete and unabridged reading of Eknath Easwaran's book The Bhagavad Gita. ",-1,-1,4.7,1988.0,280.0,-1,['-1']

The Buddha Is Still Teaching: Contemporary Buddhist Wisdom,Jack Kornfield (Editor),"When the Buddha set in motion the wheel of Dharma, he knew that the teaching he gave was inexhaustible - that every future generation would find its own skillful ways to convey it to the hearts and minds of those ready to hear.

The selections it contains, from today's most highly regarded contemporary Buddhist teachers, bring the Dharma eloquently to life for us in our own time, place, and culture. They demonstrate that two and a half millennia have done nothing to diminish the freshness of the Buddhist teachings, or their universal applicability to our lives. Contributors include: Ajahn Chah, Joko Beck, Sylvia Boorstein, Tara Brach, Pema Chdrn, the Dalai Lama, Ram Dass, Mark Epstein, Norman Fischer, Natalie Goldberg, Joseph Goldstein, Dilgo Khyentse, Jack Kornfield, Noah Levine, Stephen Levine, Sakyong Mipham, Sharon Salzberg, Suzuki Roshi, Robert Thurman, Thich Nhat Hanh, and Tulku Thondup.",-1,-1,4.5,31.0,100.0,-1,['-1']

The Complete Turtletrader: How 23 Novice Investors Became Overnight Millionaires,Michael W. Covel,"This is the true story behind Wall Street legend Richard Dennis, his disciples, the Turtles, and the trading techniques that made them millionaires. What happens when ordinary people are taught a system to make extraordinary money? Richard Dennis made a fortune on Wall Street by investing according to a few simple rules. Convinced that great trading was a skill that could be taught to anyone, he made a bet with his partner and ran a classified ad in the Wall Street Journal looking for novices to train. His recruits, later known as the Turtles, had anything but traditional Wall Street backgrounds; they included a professional blackjack player, a pianist, and a fantasy game designer. For two weeks, Dennis taught them his investment rules and philosophy, and set them loose to start trading, each with a million dollars of his money. By the time the experiment ended, Dennis had made $100,000,000 from his Turtles and created one killer Wall Street legend. In The Complete Turtle Trader, Michael W. Covel, best-selling author of Trend Following and managing editor of TurtleTrader.com, the leading website on the Turtles, tells their riveting story with the first ever on-the-record interviews with individual Turtles. He describes how Dennis interviewed and selected his students, details their education and experiences while working for him, and breaks down the Turtle system and rules in full. He reveals how they made astounding fortunes, and follows their lives from the original experiment to the present day. Some have grown even wealthier than ever, and include some of today's top hedge fund managers. Equally important are those who passed along their approach to a second generation of Turtles, proving that the Turtles' system truly is reproducible, and that anyone with the discipline and the desire to succeed can do as well as - or even better than - Wall Street's top hedge fund wizards. These rules worked - and still work today - for everyone.

The Enchiridion,Epictetus,"The Enchiridion is a collection of the most profound teachings of Epictetus (c. 55-135 AD), who taught that philosophy is a way of life and not just a matter of theory. The Enchiridion is a canonical text of Stoic philosophy, and contains all the fundamentals. Among them is the principle of not being concerned with that which is out of one’s control. Misfortune should not disturb the individual at all, and should not be perceived negatively. Epictetus teaches that the only genuine value exists in virtuous action and accepting everything that happens in the world. He believed that one should do what is right and remain indifferent to criticism. Epictetus was highly regarded by the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, the early Christian philosopher Origen, and the Neo-Platonist Simplicius of Cilicia, among others. His philosophy features in popular novels like A Man in Full by Tom Wolfe and A House for Mr Biswas by V.S. Naipaul.",-1,-1,4.5,437.0,281.0,-1,['-1']

The underlying issues raised by Betty Friedan strike at the core of the problems women still face at home and in the marketplace.

The Forest of Enchantments is also a very human story of some of the other women in the epic, often misunderstood and relegated to the margins: Kaikeyi, Surpanakha, Mandodari. A powerful comment on duty, betrayal, infidelity and honour, it is also about women's struggle to retain autonomy in a world that privileges men, as Chitra transforms an ancient story into a gripping, contemporary battle of wills.

Most executives manage their companies as if the solution to that problem lies in the external environment - find an attractive market, formulate the right strategy, win new customers. But when Bain & Company's Chris Zook and James Allen (authors of the best-selling Profit from the Core) researched this question, they found that when companies fail to achieve their growth targets, 90 percent of the time the root causes are internal, not external - increasing distance from the front lines, loss of accountability, proliferating processes and bureaucracy, to name only a few. What's more, companies experience a set of predictable internal crises, at predictable stages, as they grow. Even for healthy companies, these crises, if not managed properly, stifle the ability to grow further - and can actively lead to decline. ",-1,-1,4.3,126.0,668.0,-1,['-1']

To revitalize the plant, he follows piecemeal advice from an elusive former college professor who teaches, for example, that reduction in the efficiency of some plant operations may make the entire operation more productive. Alex's attempts to find the path to profitability and to engage his employees in the struggle involve the listener; and thankfully the authors' economic models, including a game with matchsticks and bowls, are easy to understand. Although some characters are as anonymous as the goods manufactured in the factory, others ring true. In addition, the tender story of Alex and his wife's separation and reconciliation makes a touching contrast to the rest of the book.

The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes And The Deep Laws Of The Cosmos,Brian Greene,"There was a time when “universe” meant all there is. Everything. Yet, in recent years discoveries in physics and cosmology have led a number of scientists to conclude that our universe may be one among many. With crystal-clear prose and inspired use of analogy, Brian Greene shows how a range of different “multiverse” proposals emerges from theories developed to explain the most refined observations of both subatomic particles and the dark depths of space: a multiverse in which you have an infinite number of doppelgängers, each reading this sentence in a distant universe; a multiverse comprising a vast ocean of bubble universes, of which ours is but one; a multiverse that endlessly cycles through time, or one that might be hovering millimeters away yet remains invisible; another in which every possibility allowed by quantum physics is brought to life. Or, perhaps strangest of all, a multiverse made purely of mathematics.

The House Of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty And The Rise Of Modern Finance,Ron Chernow,"Winner of the National Book Award and now considered a classic, The House of Morgan is the most ambitious history ever written about an American banking dynasty. Acclaimed by the Wall Street Journal as ""brilliantly researched and written"", the book tells the rich, panoramic story of four generations of Morgans and the powerful, secretive firms they spawned. It is the definitive account of the rise of the modern financial world. A gripping history of banking and the booms and busts that shaped the world on both sides of the Atlantic, The House of Morgan traces the trajectory of the J. P.Morgan empire from its obscure beginnings in Victorian London to the crash of 1987. Ron Chernow paints a fascinating portrait of the private saga of the Morgans and the rarefied world of the American and British elite in which they moved. Based on extensive interviews and access to the family and business archives, The House of Morgan is an investigative masterpiece, a compelling account of a remarkable institution and the men who ran it, and an essential book for understanding the money and power behind the major historical events of the last 150 years.",-1,-1,4.4,365.0,1338.0,-1,['-1']

When individuals with healthy emotional backgrounds meet, the irresistible love force creates a sustainable, reciprocal and stable relationship.

The soul mate of the codependent's dreams will become the emotional manipulator of their nightmares.

"The Laws Of Simplicity: Design, Technology, Business, Lifedesign, Technology, Business, Life",John Maeda,"Finally, we are learning that simplicity equals sanity. We’re rebelling against technology that’s too complicated, DVD players with too many menus, and software accompanied by 75-megabyte “read me” manuals. The iPod’s clean gadgetry has made simplicity hip. But sometimes we ﬁnd ourselves caught up in the simplicity paradox: we want something that’s simple and easy to use, but also does all the complex things we might ever want it to do. In The Laws of Simplicity, John Maeda offers ten laws for balancing simplicity and complexity in business, technology, and design - guidelines for needing less and actually getting more. Maeda - a professor in MIT’s Media Lab and a world-renowned graphic designer - explores the question of how we can redeﬁne the notion of “improved” so that it doesn’t always mean something more, something added on. Maeda’s ﬁrst law of simplicity is reduce. It’s not necessarily beneﬁcial to add technology features just because we can. And the features that we do have must be organized (Law 2) in a sensible hierarchy so users aren’t distracted by features and functions they don’t need. But simplicity is not less just for the sake of less. Skip ahead to Law 9: “failure: Some things can never be made simple.” Maeda’s concise guide to simplicity in the digital age shows us how this idea can be a cornerstone of organizations and their products - how it can drive both business and technology. We can learn to simplify without sacriﬁcing comfort and meaning, and we can achieve the balance described in Law 10. This law, which Maeda calls “the one,” tells us: “Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious, and adding the meaningful.” ",2 hours and 44 minutes,",#4,444 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#1 in Graphic Design,#7 in Industrial Engineering (Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#127 in Business Careers",4.1,108.0,469.0,,"['', '#4', '444 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals)', '#1 in Graphic Design', '#7 in Industrial Engineering (Audible Audiobooks & Originals)', '#127 in Business Careers']"

Here Pema provides the tools to deal with the problems and difficulties that life throws our way. This wisdom is always available to us, she teaches, but we usually block it with habitual patterns rooted in fear. Beyond that fear lies a state of openheartedness and tenderness. This audiobook teaches us how to awaken our basic goodness and connect with others, to accept ourselves and others complete with faults and imperfections, and to stay in the present moment by seeing through the strategies of ego that cause us to resist life as it is.

The Power Of Intention: Learning To Co-Create Your World Your Way,Dr. Wayne W.

In this view, an attitude that combines hard work with an indefatigable drive toward excellence is the way to succeed. However, intention is viewed very differently in this audiobook. Dr. Wayne W. Dyer has researched intention as a force in the universe that allows the act of creation to take place. This audiobook explores intention, not as something you do, but as an energy you're a part of. We're all intended here through the invisible power of intention. This is the first audiobook to look at intention as a field of energy that you can access to begin co-creating your life with the power of intention.

The Power Of Mindful Learning,Ellen J. Langer,"Radical in its implications, this original and important work may change forever the views we hold about the nature of learning. In The Power of Mindful Learning, Ellen Langer uses her innovative theory of mindulness, introduced in her influential earlier book, to dramatically enhance the way we learn. In business, sports, laboratories, or at home, our learning is hobbled by certain antiquated and pervasive misconceptions. In this pithy, liberating, and delightful book she gives us a fresh, new view of learning in the broadest sense. Such familiar notions as delayed gratification, ”the basics”, or even ”right answers”, are all incapacitating myths which Langer explodes one by one. She replaces them with her concept of mindful or conditional learning which she demonstrates, with fascinating examples from her research, to be extraordinarily effective. ",-1,-1,4.5,62.0,500.0,-1,['-1']

The Silk Roads: A New History Of The World,Peter Frankopan,"The sun is setting on the Western world. Slowly but surely, the direction in which the world spins has reversed: where for the last five centuries the globe turned westward on its axis, it now turns to the east.... For centuries fame and fortune were to be found in the West - in the New World of the Americas. Today it is the East that calls out to those in search of adventure and riches. The region stretching from Eastern Europe and sweeping right across Central Asia, deep into China and India, is taking center stage in international politics, commerce, and culture - and is shaping the modern world. This region, the true center of the Earth, is obscure to many in the English-speaking world. Yet this is where civilization itself began, where the world's great religions were born and took root. The Silk Roads were no exotic series of connections but networks that linked continents and oceans together. Along them flowed ideas, goods, disease, and death. This was where empires were won - and where they were lost. As a new era emerges, the patterns of exchange are mirroring those that have criss-crossed Asia for millennia. The Silk Roads are rising again. A major reassessment of world history, The Silk Roads is an important account of the forces that have shaped the global economy and the political renaissance in the reemerging East.

The Silva Ultramind Esp System,Michael Wickett,"Unleash the telepathic powers you were born with! Skeptical? I was, until I proved it to myself. You see, telepathic powers exist in all of us; they are part of the natural way we communicate with each other. Your brain beats at various frequencies, much like your heart. Usually your brain beats at 14 cycles per second, the Beta frequency. Very occasionally it beats between 7 and 14 cycles per second. This frequency is known as Alpha frequency. Alpha is the key to becoming telepathic. A man named Jose Silva perfected a simple 15-minute technique for entering the Alpha level at will, creating his own brand of ESP, which he called ""effective sensory projection"". The result of this breakthrough is the new Silva Ultramind ESP System.

What Works: Gender Equality By Design,Iris Bohnet,"Gender equality is a moral and a business imperative. But unconscious bias holds us back, and de-biasing people’s minds has proven to be difficult and expensive. Diversity training programs have had limited success, and individual effort alone often invites backlash. Behavioral design offers a new solution. By de-biasing organizations instead of individuals, we can make smart changes that have big impacts. Presenting research-based solutions, Iris Bohnet hands us the tools we need to move the needle in classrooms and boardrooms, in hiring and promotion, benefiting businesses, governments, and the lives of millions. What Works is built on new insights into the human mind.

He brings to his treatment of these questions the same courage, scrupulous logic, and lofty wisdom for which his other work as philosopher, writer, and teacher has been famous.

Wild,Cheryl Strayed,"A powerful, blazingly honest memoir: the story of an 1100-mile solo hike that broke down a young woman reeling from catastrophe and built her back up again. At 22, Cheryl Strayed thought she had lost everything. After her mother's death, her family scattered and her own marriage was destroyed. Four years later, with nothing more to lose, she decided to hike the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State - alone. She had no experience as a long-distance hiker, and the trail was little more than an idea: vague, outlandish, and full of promise. But it was a promise of piecing together a life that had come undone. Strayed faces rattlesnakes and bears, intense heat and record snowfalls, and both the beauty and intense loneliness of the trail.

Building on her four principles of eating right from Don't Lose Your Mind, Lose Your Weight, she goes on to share her four strategies (Nutrition, Exercise, Sleep and Relationships) for each of these phases and especially the lifestyle disorders of Pcod, hypothyroid and diabetes. Rujuta, in her usual indomitable style, debunks (rubbishes rather) myths related to food, hormones and workouts; forces us to rethink our belief that pregnancy, menopause, hypothyroid, etc, come in the way of losing weight; and reveals just how easy it is to remain healthy, strong and fit through one's life.

You Are The Placebo Meditation 1: Changing Two Beliefs And Perceptions,Dr. Joe Dispenza,"Dr. Joe Dispenza has created two meditation recordings - featuring different music - to accompany his book You Are the Placebo. In this longer 56-minute audio, Dr. Joe walks you through Meditation 1: Changing Two Beliefs and Perceptions. After introducing the open-focus technique, he then moves you into the practice of finding the present moment. When you discover the sweet spot of the present moment and you forget about yourself as the personality you have always been, you have access to other possibilities that already exist in the quantum field.
